          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Personalized education LIVE from the comfort of your home</h2>
         <p className='text-gray-700 '>Vidyarjan's strength is its core focus on personalized LIVE online teaching. This ensures a student gets the entire attention of a dedicated teacher and learns at his/her pace. The interaction between the teacher and students is strong and two-way, which is also monitored technologically for further improvement (if needed). The student is encouraged to ask doubts/questions unlike in a crowded classroom. And the student is much comfortable in asking his/her doubts on Vidyarjan than anywhere else, as teachers instill questioning skills along with imparting theoretical knowledge. Enhanced engagement between student and teacher on Vidyarjan guarantees better understanding and recall for the student; unlike in a classroom where teacher-student engagement is difficult to measure. And of course, the student is learning from the comfort of his/her own home – Learning happens best when the student's mind is relaxed!</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Better than recorded lectures</h2>
          <p className='text-gray-700'>The MOOCS revolution claimed to ensure that quality education is available to all and this will solve the maladies that the education system suffers from. However, the basic problem has not been solved- that of assembly line education production. The ensuing 'One Size Fits All solution' is still completely against the very ethos of personalized education.</p>
         <p className='text-gray-700'>LIVE teaching is a very important component of personalized education.</p>
         <p className='text-gray-700'>With Vidyarjan's respectable experience in teaching and mentoring more than 10,000 students, we can safely claim that. Especially in the K12 segment, a child lacks motivation and has to be mentored apart from teaching. Neither a recorded lecture nor the complete reliance on educational institution can help here- it does not encourage or support serious learning. It may serve the purpose of knowledge transfer but fails miserably in engaging the student, to develop interest, to interact and support at tricky points. To cater to the dynamic needs of a young student, what is needed is a friendly and enthusiastic teacher who can match the level of a child and explain every concept in a way he or she understands. You'll agree, it is next to impossible to achieve this in a recorded lecture or a crowded class of 40 odd students.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Time and Energy saving, Secured solution</h2>
          <p className='text-gray-700'>Increasingly, security of children while commuting is at risk. Parents are not comfortable if young students need to travel long hours and distances for a professional coaching class, wasting energy, taking health and security risks.</p>
         <p className='text-gray-700'>Vidyarjan offers a solution to this modern malady.</p>
         <p className='text-gray-700'>Now every student can get world class coaching support for professional courses. He or she can completely bypass this wasteful travel time and energy, and focus only on studies from the comfort of home. Time saved is time earned for more productive relaxing activities- a hobby, relaxing with family, or that rare commodity for every student- plain rest!</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Anywhere- Anytime Learning</h2>
          <p className='text-gray-700'>The conventional classroom method mandates that learning has to be limited to a place and constrained by time. We believe, learning should not be time bound. Nor should teaching be. Vidyarjan breaks the shackles of time and place, liberating learning and teaching from the limits of time and location. Now even late at night, or early in the morning, a student has the liberty to reach out for guidance and help... and teachers at Vidyarjan will be all excited to lend their helping hands!</p>
         <p className='text-gray-700'>Every session conducted on Vidyarjan is highly personalized, the pedagogy and lesson plans of the teachers are tailor-made to meet the need of students. Moreover, the pace of the lecture is governed by the grasping capabilities of the student. That is the biggest strength of Vidyarjan's concepts!</p>
         <p className='text-gray-700'>Thats not all of it, there are a couple of more salient features at Vidyarjan that we bet, you won't be able to find anywhere else.</p>
