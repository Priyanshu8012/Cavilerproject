          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Superior Teachers</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Four simple words to define our Teachers - Excellent People, Brilliant Minds! At Vidyarjan Science Academy, teaching is not just a profession. For our teachers, it is a commitment and a matter of pride and responsibility. We do not have any teachers who teach merely for money, year on year.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Our elite group of teachers is a network of passionate individuals who want to contribute towards better learning outcomes and performance of students. Above all, we are a group focused on bringing happiness and joy through learning.
          </p>

            Most of the teachers at Vidyarjan Science Academy have cracked the toughest examinations themselves and are well qualified and experienced. Who else would know the value of hard work involved and students' psychology better than them!
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700">

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Cutting Edge Technology</h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Vidyarjan Science Academy is a technology company at the core. Our RDX Team (Research, Develop, and Explore) is creating technology in education to bring forth a disruptive positive impact - to create more <span className='font-bold'>Teachers by Choice</span>, to make <span className='font-bold'> quality education more accessible & affordable. </span>We have created cutting edge technology from the scratch to power the following brilliant features on Vidyarjan Science Academy:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc ml-12 list-outside text-gray-700 mb-4">
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>LIVE audio-video connection Between Teacher & Student at very low Internet bandwidths.</strong>
              <p className='text-gray-700'>Connecting two individuals live with audio-video communication even at very low internet bandwidths requires complex and sophisticated technology. We at Vedantu have mastered it. Thousands of students residing in remote corners of India with poor internet connection have already benefited with our technology, something we are really proud of!</p>
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Shared live learning environment (Whiteboard)between student and teacher.</strong>
              <p className='text-gray-700'>We realized that best learning happens when a teacher personally sits with a student to discuss and teach him/her on a notebook shared between them. This is precisely what shared Whiteboard on Vedantu replicates for student and teacher sitting thousands of kilometres away. We have put in months of energy in creating technology to make shared Whiteboard extremely seamless and intuitive for both teachers and students. Both teachers and students can not only write but also upload images to ask questions and/or explain concepts.</p>
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Replay of the every LIVE session between teacher-student on Vedantu for the purpose of revision and review.</strong> 
              <p className='text-gray-700'>We understand that continuous revision is the best way for a student to strengthen his/her concepts. Our technology enables recording of each session between a teacher and student, which can be available for the student to revise later. We also use this recording to review the quality of teaching on Vedantu. Our technology optimizes session recordings to make it possible to replay them at very low bandwidths even on mobile devices.</p>
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>Learning Management Tools</strong> 
              <p className='text-gray-700'>Along with creating awesome learning management tool, our geeks have also developed a comprehensive performance and feedback reporting system. This would help teachers to share regular feedback on student's academic performance and other learning outcomes. It would also help students and parents to realize the weak areas in advance and start with remedial action well in advance.</p>
            </li>
            <li className="mb-2">
              <strong>
              LIVE Session on Mobile Devices</strong> 
              <p className='text-gray-700'>We have created tools for holistic learning management that essentially includes teaching-learning content creation, sharing and evaluation. The content can range from a simple object test to creative assignments to session notes and yet have a lot of variation within it. Teacher can also create and share audio-video assignments/test to which the students can respond using either web or mobile app.</p>
